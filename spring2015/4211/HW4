CSCI 4707



1) What is 1-persisent CSMA? Under what condition in terms of traffic load, 1-
persistent CSMA will outperform non-persistent CSMA? Why?

Aloha is a protocol to distribute access over a shared broadcast channel. 
CSMA will listen instead first before sending to avoid collisions. 
1-persistent CSMA will send as soon as channel is idle. This will outperform
non-persistent CSMA when traffic is heavily idle. Because non-persistent CSMA
will waste time just waiting even when traffic is heavily idle. When traffic
is heavily idle then 1-persistent CSMA will not have too many problems with
collisions.



2) CSMA/CD: Suppose a CSMA/CD network is running at 100Mbps over a
1000m cable with no repeaters. The signal speed in the cable is 200,000
km/sec. Compute the following parameters:

a. End-to-end propagation delay.

Propagation delay = 1000/200,000 = .005 ms

b. Worst-case collision detection time

2 times the propagation delay = .01 ms

c. Minimum frame size

(Worst-case collision detection time) * (Link Speed) = Minimum Frame size

.01 ms * 100 Mbps = 1kb Frame size.


3) Describe IEEE 802.4 network (Token Bus). Please pay attention to how the
network operates and how to make sure the network to be reliable.

A token ring protocol allows a holder of to transmit information on the medium.
The token bus networks implements this protocol on a wired network. A user on 
the network has to have a token that it transmits and it must know the address
of all nodes neighboring it.If a node does not have anything to send 
then the token is passed onto it's neighbor. 

The network is unreliable because there is a single point of failure. If a 
the node with the token fails then network can no longer allow communication.
A fix to this problem is to spawn/recreate a token when one gets lost.

A solution to fixing a lost token in a failed node is to implement a monitor.
The monitor will keep track of where the current token is and regenerate a
token. If the monitor goes down then turn a node in the token ring into a 
monitor.


4)
A CDMA receiver get the following chips: (+1 -1 +3 -1 +1 +3 -1 -1).
Assuming the chip sequence defined as follows:
     (1 -1  3 -1  1  3-1 -1).
- A: (-1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 -1) -1 -1 -3 1 -1 -3 -1 1 = -8/8  = -1
- B: (-1 1 -1  1  1  1-1 -1) -1 -1 -3-1  1  3  1 1 = 0
- C: (-1 -1 1 -1 1 1 1 -1)   -1  1  3 1  1  3 -1 1 = 8/8 = 1
- D: (-1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 1 1)   -1  1 -3 -1 1 -3 -1 -1 = -8/8 = -1

Which stations are transmitting and what bit was sent by each transmitting
station?

A transmitting 0
B transmitting nothing
C transmitting 1
D transmitting 0
