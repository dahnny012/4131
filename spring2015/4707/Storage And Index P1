Pages:
    The unit of information read from or written to disk.
    Typical values 4kb,8kb


#Data on External Storage    
Disks:
    Can retrieve random page at fixed cost.
        reads on consectuive pages is much cheaper than
        random order.
        
Tapes: 
    Pages are sequentially read.
        Cheaper($) than disk.

File organization:
    Arranging a file of records on ext. storage.
        rid - used to identify disk address of the page
        that has the record.
        
        indexes - Way to find rid based on a search key.

# Data on External Storage(Archeitecture)

Buffer Manager:
    Reads data into memory and writes back to disk.
    
    rids are passed to the manager to locate a page
    in memory
    
Disk space manager:
    Allocates disk space upon request.
    
    Also tracks free pages
    
#Disks and Files

DBMS: stores information on disk
    Read: transfer data from disk to memory
    
    Write: transfer data from ram to disk.
    
    A disk io is high cost. Try to minimize.
    
Why Not Store Everything in Main Memory?
    
    Disk space is cheaper in size than memory.
    
    Memory is cannot persist through a crash.
    
#Components of a Disk

Spins
Layered disk platters.
Many heads but only one reads/writes at one time.


#Accessing a Disk Page

Disk IO:
    seek time: moving arms to position disk head on track.
    rotational delay: waiting for block to rotate under head.
    transfer time: actually moving data to/from disk surface.
    
Majority Cost:
    Seek and rotational delay dominate.
    
Key to lower IO cost:
    Reduce seek/rotation.
    Software/Hardware solutions

#Disks

Advantage over tapes:
    random access > sequential.

Data is stored and retrieved in units called disks blocks or pages.
    
**** Unlike Ram , location on disk matters. Memory locality = better speed.


#Storage Hierarchy

Hierarchy:
    CPU cache
    RAM
    Disk
    Tapes
    
#Buffer Manager

Purpose:
    Software layer resposible for bringing pages from disk to memory.
    
Managing:
    Partitions memory(buffer pool) into a collection of pages(frames).
    
Limitations:
    All of the db cannot be put into memory so manager brings
    in pages as needed. What pages is determined by replacement
    policy.
    
#Buffer Pool
    [x][ ][x][ ][][] Disk Page
    [ ][ ][ ][ ][][] Free frame
    [ ][ ][ ][x][][]

    Data must be in memory for operations.
    
    <frame#,pageid> pairs is maintained.
    
    Every frame has:
        Pin_count:
            number of users who are using that frame.
            
        Dirty bit:
            memory has been modified since being put into buffer
            will need to be written to disk if it has.

# When a Page is Requested...
-------------------
Not in Pool:
    Open page frames(pin_count =0)
        choose one
        if dirty write to disk.
        read page into frame.
        
Pin the page (increment the pin count) and return its return address.
---------------------
    
If requests can be predicted (e.g. sequential scans) then
pages can be pre-fetched several pages at a time.

# More Buffer Management

Requestor of page is resposible for unpinning and dirtying.
    
Page in the pool may be requested many times
    A page can only be replaced if pin_count = 0
    
If no frame has zero pin_count and a new paeg is requested:
    Wait until some page is released.
    Abort transaction

Multiple transactions pinning a page may result in conflicts.
    Concurrency to the rescue.
    
#Buffer Replacement Policy

A frame is chosen by a replacement policy.

LRU:
    Can be implemented as a queue of pointers for frames
    with zero pin count.
    
    Frame is added to end when pin_count = 0
    
    Head is chosen
    
LRU + Clock:
    var current = 1....N
    
    if !(current ok)
        current++;
    
    frame{
        reference = 0 , 1 if pin_count = 0
    }
    
    if(current.reference == 1)
        reference = 0
        current++
        // This way, a recently reference page is less likely to
        // be replaced.
    
    if(current.pin_count = 0,reference = 0)
        return current
        
#Buffer Replacement Policy Continued.

Suprise Suprise Policy has a impact on # Disk I/Os

Sequential Flooding:
    Nasty situation caused by LRU + repeated sequential scans
        #buffer frames < # pages in file means constant page fault.
        
Other policies:
    MRU,Random,FIFO,Random
    
# DBMS vs OS File System 

*** OS does disk and buffer management, why not let it take care of db?

Good question my son.

Differences in OS support: portability issues.

Buffer Management in DBMS requires abiltiy to:
    pin a page/force a page.
    
    adjust replacement policy and pre fetch pages
    based on patterns.


#Record Formats: Fixed Length

    [L1][L2][L3][L4]
    
    Address = B+L1+L2
    
Information about field types same for all records in a file.
Stored in system catalogs

Finding ith field does not require scan record.


#System Catalogs

For each index:
    structure and search key fields.
    
For each relation:
    name,file name,file structure (e.g. Heap File)
    attribute name and type for each attribute
    index name, for each index
    integrity constraints.
    
For each view:
    view name and definition

Stats:
    authorization,buffer pool size ... etc.
    Catalogs are stored as relations 
    
#Some catalog im not going to draw.


#Record Formats: Variable Length

Two alternative formats (# fields is fixed):

    #1
    Field Count F
    Delimiter $
    [F][  ][$][  ][$][  ][$][  ][$]
    
    #2
    Pointer p
    [p1][p2][p3][ p1 ][  p2  ][ p3   ]
    Array of field offsets

#2 offers direct access to ith field, efficient
storage of nulls; small directory overhead.


#Page Formats: Fixed Length Records

Packed vs Unpacked:

    Packed:
        Contigous Space.
        N = # number of records.
        
    Unpacked:
        Fragmented Contigous Space.
        Bitmap to maintain open spaces.

record id = <page id,slot #>
    In first alternative, moving records for free space
    management changes rid. may not be acceptable.



#Page Formats: Variable Length Records

A index of array pointers to point to pages.

Can move records on page without changing rid;
so, attractive for fixed-length records too.

#File of Records

Page or block is OK when doing I/O,  
but higher levels of DBMS operate on records
and files of records.

File:
    A collection of pages, each containing a collection of records.
    Must support:
        - insert/delete/modify record.
        - read a particular record.
        - scan all records (possibly with some condititions on the records
        to be retrieved.

#Unordered (Heap) Files

Simplest file structure, no particular order.

growing and shrinking, disk pages are allocated and de-allocated.

To support record level operations we must:
    keep track of the pages in a file. 
    keep track of free space on pages.
    keep track of the records on a page.
    
There are many alternatives for keeping track of this.


#Heap File Implemented as a List

Two lists:
    One with pages
    One with free pages

The header page id and Heap file name must be stored someplace.

Each page contains 2 pointers plus data.


#Heap File Using A Page Directory

Page Tables linked.

Entry for a page can include number of free bytes on the page.

The directory os a collection of pages;
