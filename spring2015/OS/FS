#Consistency Semantics

    What happens in case of conflicts?
    
    
    Unix Semantics:
        Writes are immediatly visible to all users.
        
    Session Semantics:
        Session: series of accesses between open,close
        
        Changes are visible to later sessions only after
            Each user is given a copy of the file.

            This is called a session.
                User a has a file , does some read and write. close
                
                User b,c same thing....etc
                
                Any changes to a file after open, is visible to you.
                
                After a close changes are visible to everyone.
                
                This can allow for caching multiple writes.
        
        Immutable file smantics:
            A shared file cannot be changed.
            
#File Protection

    How to prevent unathoreized users from accessing files?
    
    Access Controler:Access dependent on user identtiy.
    
    Techiques:
        Access control list(acl): Each file has a list of users
        and their access types. Problem?
        
        Access attributes: user,group, others. Could allow
        ACL to be added if needed.
        
        Password protection: Each file (or group) has a 
        password. Problem?

        In reality not many will be designed this way.
        Abstracted like this for learning purposes.

    Logical File System:

        file organization, e.g directories
        
        file control block(FCB): file indo,e.g., inode
        
    File-Organization module:
        Translates logical file blocks to physical blocks
        
        Free space management and block allocation

    Basic File System:
        Peformes IO on storage device....

#Mount Table

    In-memory mount table:
        COntains entries for mounted file systems
        
        each entry contains a pointer to file system,types
        
        Windows: Entries for each drive(C:,D:,etc.)
        
        Unix: In-memory inode of mount point directory
        is flagged, contains pointer to mount table entry
        
        
    What does OS do while mounting a volume?
        
        Verifies that device contains valid file system
        
        Adds an entry in the in-memory mont table.
        
#File Control Block

    "file level metadata"
    
    Contains metadata about file:
        Unix->inode
        File properties
        pointers to disk blocks containing file data
        
    Directory can be treated as a special file.
        Can have its own FCB
        
        Will contain list of <filename,FCB>
        
    
#Inode Structure
    
    [File Properties]
    [Direct Data Block pointers]
    [single,
        double,
            triple indirect ptr]
    
    Generally fairly small.
    
    Any reason?
        Theres a lot of files lul.
        
#In-Memory File Tables

    System-wide open-file table:
        Contains FC
        
        ...
        
        
#UNIX: In-Memory File Tables

    In-Memory table:
        For every file you open, contains a inode.
        
        You just need one inode a file.
    
    Per-Process Open-File Table:
        FD is a index in this.
        
    System File Table:
        2 process opening a file = 2 entries in the table.
        
        Seems Redundant but keeps track of open mode
        and offset
    
    Why Unix WHY!!!
        When you fork a process you want to keep that informaton.
        
        Useful in Pipes.
        
    
#File Open

    What happens when user calls:
        open("file","RW")
    
    Several steps:
        Search system-wide open-file table for file1 FCB
        
        If not found, search directory structure(cached in memory
        or from disk)
        
        Copy file1 FCB into system-wide open-file table
        
        Create a new entry in per-process table pointing to file1 FCB
        in system table.
        
        Initialize mode(RW), file offset in per-prrocess table entry
        
        return index to per-process table entry as the file descriptor
        
    
    read(fd,100,buf)
    
    1. Use the fd to index into the process table.
    
    2. Use this to find the inode.
    
    3. Check Permissions.
    
    4. Find disk location corresponding to the offset.
    4a. Find it in cache.
    
    5. Read the data.

#Caching and Buffering

    When a file is read in by a process:
        data may be accessed multipel timesb y the process
        data may be accessed by other processes
        
    When a file is written by a process:
        Data may be used again in the near future
        Sync write to disk may be slow
        
    Would like to cache file data
        Going back to disk will be slow
        
    Buffer cache
        Disk blocks are kept in memory
        
#Memory Mapping

    A file is mapped to a region of virtual memory
        File i/o is done read/write to memory region
        
    Page Cache
        File contents are cached in units of pages
        can be managed by virtual memory system
    

#Unified Buffer Cache

    What if we have seperate buffer cache and page cache?
    Where does data get cached for:
        regular I/O via read/write syscalls
        memory-mapped file i/o via virtual addresses
    
    Double caching: Same data is duplicated in both
    buffer and page cache.


#Caching Issues

    How to parition mmeory between process pages and file system page cache
        tradeoff between thrashing and io performance
        
    WHen to write data from cache to disk.
        sync:written directly to disk in order
        async:written from cache later,maybe out-of-order
        
    
    Cache Replacment:
        Sequential-access file: LRU?
            doesnt matter
        Free-behind/read-ahead: free blocks as read,prefetch subsequent blocks.
