B:
1.List three advantages of using DBMS compared to using File
System to store your data.
    - A DBMS is able to provide faster searches because it is able to index results.  
    - A DBMS provides allows concurrent users from reading and writing to the databases.
    - Provides a abstraction to managing data to speed up application development time.
    
2. What are the 6 steps in designing a DBMS?
    1. Requirement analysis
    2. Conceptual Database Design
    3. Logical Database Design 
    4. Scheme Refinement 
    5. Physical Database Design 
    6. Application and Security Design 
    
    
C.  Imagine you are designing a Database for an
Auction House. The Database will contain information about its Customers
(identified uniquely by customer id/custid) and the Products they bought
(identified uniquely by product id/pid). For simplicity, each customer can
only purchase in the Auction House once a day (identified by date id/did).
For each situation below, draw an ER diagram that describes it.

    a.We want to keep track only the last time each customer buy a
    specific set of products.
